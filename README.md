# Student Math Score Prediction System

## Overview

The **Student Math Score Prediction System** is an end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** that predicts a student’s **Math exam score** based on multiple academic and demographic factors.

The project follows a modular, production-style architecture and provides predictions through a **Flask-based web interface**.

## Project Description

Student performance in Mathematics is influenced by various factors such as:

- Gender  
- Parental level of education  
- Lunch type  
- Test preparation course  
- Reading score  
- Writing score  

This system uses these features to **predict the Math score** using a trained machine learning model.

## Objectives

- Identify key factors affecting Math performance  
- Build a reliable ML model for Math score prediction  
- Implement an end-to-end ML pipeline  
- Provide predictions via a web interface  
- Maintain clean, scalable project structure with logging
